				<h2>Why Become A Web Developer? </h2>
				<h5> September 20, 2021 by Itawnya Walker </h5>
				
				<p> <img src="entry1.png" alt="picture of Itawnya Walker" class="img1"> Web development combines creativity and analytical skills perfectly. It's for the detail-orientated and those with an eye for design. But, if no other reason inspires, the salary certainly will. With demand going strong, the average UK web developer earns £42,500, according to IT Jobs Watch. This represents a 6.25 percent increase since this time last year and an increase of 3.90 percent from the year before that. Plus, if you specialise, your earning potential could double. Obviously, there's much more on offer than money. The web developer role can be varied, fulfilling, and most importantly, fun. </p>
				
				<p> A large number of developers out there don't have any formal qualifications. Of course, a degree in computer science is extremely advantageous, however, a lot of the same skills can be self-taught. If you know a programming language and have experience with database management, there's nothing stopping you pursuing a career in web development. A lot of organisations offer training on the job, so you'll be up to speed before you know it. In fact, the amount of bedroom developers is growing, and with companies like Udemy and Coursera providing online development courses from £15, you can just get stuck in. </p>

				<h2>Don't Know What to do With Your Life? </h2>
				<h5> August 20, 2021 by Itawnya Walker </h5>
				
				<p> <img src="entry2.png" alt="picture of Itawnya Walker" class="img2"> In order to know what career(s) might be a good fit, you first need to know yourself and what's important to you. Identifying your needs and preferences can really help you narrow down what it is you're looking for in a job. Using your evaluation results, you may be able to identify some potential careers to pursue. Some of the initial narrowing down may be easy. For example, if you find that you have a more extroverted personality, you may want to look for careers that involve interacting with people on a regular basis.  If you're having difficulty thinking of a good match, there are a variety of career assessments you can take that can guide you on the right path.  </p>
				
				<p> Once you've narrowed down your options, you can start researching the fields you're drawn toward. This includes reading everything from job descriptions to news articles to blog posts about them. The more research you do and the wider variety of sources you pull from, the better idea you'll have of whether or not a certain career is for you. </p>
